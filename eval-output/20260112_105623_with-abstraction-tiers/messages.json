Homepage with hero section and feature cards\n2. Docs pages with sidebar navigation\n3. Search with Ctrl+K keyboard shortcut\n4. Theme toggle (dark/light mode)\n5. API reference section\n\nDEPLOY THE FULL GAS TOWN HIERARCHY:\n- Mayor (you): Coordinate everything, be LIBERAL with agent spawning\n- Explorer: Scout the codebase first\n- Witnesses: Monitor frontend and styling work\n- Specialists: Implement features (one per feature)\n- Reviewer: Code quality gate\n- Refinery: Process merge queue\n- Deacon: Agent patrol\n\nIMPORTANT PRINCIPLES (from Agent Abstraction Tiers):\n1. You (Mayor) should spawn persistent agents LIBERALLY via the API - use the full role hierarchy\n2. Non-spawning roles (specialists, reviewers, refinery) should use native Task tool subagents HEAVILY for exploration, research, and verification to prevent context rot\n3. Every agent should be delegating constantly - work flows down, only results and blockers flow up\n4. This evaluates the new delegation patterns\n\nCreate beads for each feature. Assign them to specialists. Begin immediately - do not wait for confirmation.","read":true,"type":"action_required"},{"id":"2de0eb06-0c04-4f20-b1d4-999ae9109968","from":"scout","to":"mayor","timestamp":"2026-01-12T18:21:27.886Z","content":"RECON COMPLETE: eval-docportal codebase analysis\n\n## Tech Stack\n- **React** 19.2.0 (latest)\n- **Vite** 7.2.4 (build/dev server)\n- **TypeScript** ~5.9.3\n- **Tailwind CSS** 4.1.18 + @tailwindcss/typography\n- **PostCSS** + Autoprefixer\n- **ESLint** 9.x with react-hooks & react-refresh plugins\n\n## Project Structure\n```\neval-docportal/\n├── src/\n│   ├── App.tsx (main component - default Vite counter)\n│   ├── main.tsx (React entry with StrictMode)\n│   ├── index.css (global styles)\n│   ├── App.css (component styles)\n│   └── assets/react.svg\n├── public/vite.svg\n├── index.html (entry point)\n├── vite.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.json (project refs)\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n└── package.json\n```\n\n## Current State\n- Fresh Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold\n- Default template with counter example\n- NO routing, NO state management (beyond useState), NO custom components\n- Tailwind installed but not yet configured/used in components\n- ES Modules enabled (type: module)\n\n## Key Patterns\n- Standard Vite entry: index.html -> main.tsx -> App.tsx\n- TypeScript project references for app vs node configs\n- React StrictMode enabled\n- CSS with light/dark mode support via prefers-color-scheme\n\n## Ready for Development\nThe scaffold is minimal and ready for building the docportal.
